# Hi there, I'm Danie Niebuhr 👋

I'm a passionate programmer and currently in my third and final year of a BSc in Information Technology at North West University. During my gap year, I explored various programming languages such as Java, Python, and HTML, gaining a foundational understanding of each.

I'm a passionate programmer with a deep love for creating innovative solutions through code. My journey into the world of programming began with a curiosity for how things work and has since grown into a full-fledged obsession with developing software that makes a difference. Whether it's building applications or exploring new technologies. I thrive on the challenges and continuous learning that programming offers. My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills to create impactful and efficient software that enhances everyday life.
